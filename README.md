# A realtime chatroom
 
This repository contains the source code (react-app) for a chatroom which resembles Whatsapp-web(web version of whatsapp) in UI design.
I have used the front end part of the code from my previous repo ( Whatsapp-design).
It uses google authentication.
It is hosted on Firebase.
You can chat in exisiting rooms or open a new chat room.
